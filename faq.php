                    <p><strong>1. What is FreshKit?</strong></p>

                    <p>FreshKit is a food e-commerce website that provides farm-fresh products in Sri Lanka. We aim to
                        deliver high-quality groceries right to your doorstep.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. What stores are supported?</strong></p>

                    <p>FreshKit sources products from a variety of trusted local farms and grocery stores to ensure you
                        get the freshest items available.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Do you serve my area?</strong></p>

                    <p>FreshKit currently serves multiple areas across Sri Lanka. Please enter your zip code on our
                        website to check if we deliver to your location.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. How fast do you deliver?</strong></p>

                    <p>Delivery times vary depending on your location and the availability of products. Typically,
                        deliveries are made within 24 to 48 hours of placing your order.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. How much does delivery cost?</strong></p>

                    <p>Delivery costs are calculated based on your order total and location. Specific delivery charges
                        will be displayed at checkout before you confirm your order.</p>
                    <p><strong>6. What are the delivery hours?</strong></p>

                    <p>Our delivery hours are based on the opening hours of the stores we work with. Usually between
                        10am and 10pm. You can place your orders at any time of the day.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. Can I collect any kinds of club points from the supermarkets?</strong></p>

                    <p>Currently, FreshKit does not offer the option to collect club points from supermarkets. We are
                        continuously working on expanding our services, so stay tuned for future updates.</p>
                    <p><strong>8. What happens if any of my items are out of stock?</strong></p>

                    <p>If an item is out of stock, we will notify you and provide alternative options or adjust your
                        order accordingly. You can choose to accept the substitution or receive a refund for the
                        unavailable item.</p>
                    <p><strong>9. Are there price differences from the store?</strong><br>
                        Prices on FreshKit may vary slightly from those in physical stores due to additional handling
                        and delivery costs. We strive to keep our prices competitive and transparent.</p>
                    <p><strong>10. How do you treat items that are non-Halal?</strong></p>
                    <p>FreshKit respects all dietary preferences and restrictions. We clearly label non-Halal items and
                        ensure they are handled separately to avoid any cross-contamination.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>11. Would I get the FreshKit shopping bag for my order?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, your order will be delivered in FreshKit shopping bags designed to keep your items fresh and
                        secure during transit.</p>
                    <p><strong>12.&nbsp;Can you assure the quality of the products that I bought?</strong></p>
                    <p>We take pride in providing high-quality products. If you are not satisfied with any item, please
                        contact our customer service, and we will address your concerns promptly.</p>
                    <p><strong>13. How do I check the status of my order?</strong></p>
                    <p>You can check the status of your order by logging into your FreshKit account and navigating to
                        the "Order History" section. You will also receive email updates regarding your order status.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>14. How do I edit or cancel my order?</strong></p>
                    <p>You can edit your order until the shopper starts picking your items. Go to “My Orders” section in
                        the app and select the order you want to edit. Click on “Edit Order” to change one of the
                        following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add or remove items</li>
                        <li>Change delivery slot</li>
                        <li>Change payment method</li>
                        <li>Change address</li>
                        <li>Cancel order</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>15. How do I report a problem with my order?</strong></p>
                    <p>You can contact us following the “Help” button in the app and selecting “Contact Us”. We respond
                        very quickly!</p>
                    <p><strong>16. When will I receive my refund?</strong></p>
                    <p>Payment will be made within 14 days by crediting your credit card.</p>
                    <p><strong>17. How do I review my receipt?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will receive an electronic receipt via e-mail after your order is delivered.</p>
                    <p><strong>18. How do I return my FreshKit bags?</strong></p>
                    <p>We encourage you to return your FreshKit bags that are still in good condition to your next
                        FreshKit shopper for reuse. Feel free to use them for your own errands too.</p>
                    <p><strong>19. How do I return items?</strong></p>
                    <p>If something seems to be wrong with your order, such as a missing item or an incorrect item, you
                        can reject the items when our rider arrives at your doorstep. We will charge you only for the
                        delivered items. Once an item is accepted by you, it cannot be returned. We do not currently
                        support a return process for any items you may have accidentally purchased via FreshKit. You
                        are more than welcome to coordinate returns directly with your store. Keep in mind that we do
                        keep the in-store receipts for accounting purposes.</p>
                    <p><strong>20. Why is my card authorized for more than my order total?</strong></p>
                    <p>Like a restaurant or a bar, FreshKit temporarily authorizes your card for slightly more than
                        your order total. As soon as your order is complete, we charge your card for exactly what was
                        delivered. Your bank will update the final charge on your statement in 3 – 7 business days after
                        delivery. The temporary authorization can be for up to Rp 100,000 more than the order total. It
                        helps account for charges like items sold by weight. If your final order total exceeds the
                        authorization amount, there may be a second charge for the difference. You can see all charges
                        reflected at the bottom of your receipt, which is available after delivery.</p>
                    <p><strong>21. Who will select my items?</strong></p>
                    <p>All our Personal Shoppers and Drivers are highly trained at selecting the best groceries for you.
                        We employ Personal Shoppers that pick grocery and Drivers to deliver to your doorstep; in some
                        stores, we may rely directly on Drivers to deliver your grocery.</p>
                    <p><strong>22. Who will deliver my order?</strong></p>
                    <p>Your orders will be delivered by specially trained and screened Drivers.</p>
                    <p><strong>23. What if all Personal Shoppers are busy?</strong></p>
                    <p>Occasionally our Personal Shoppers get overwhelmed with orders. During these times, the next
                        available delivery slot may be later in the day. Use the delivery checker in the app to see the
                        next available delivery for your order.</p>
                    <p><strong>24. I have many more questions for you!</strong></p>
                    <p>Contact us! We will be there at support.SL@FreshKit.com.</p>
